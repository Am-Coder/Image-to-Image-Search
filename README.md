# Image-to-Image-search
* Image-to-Image-search is a reverse image search engine. 
* Search by image: Give it an image and it will return the similar images based on the image captions.
* Uses Deep Learning for Automatic Image Captioning, Elastic search as it's search engine.
* Both Command line as well as Webapp interface provided.

## Packages Required:
* Anaconda
* Keras with Tensorflow Backend (Python 3.6)
* Elastic Search and elasticsearch-py (Elastic Search 6.0)

## Other things which are required
* Flickr-8k LSTM weights (flickr8k\_cnn\_lstm\_v1.p)
* Flickr-8k dataset is required.

### Files
* `extract_feat.py` : Takes in image, returns the feature vector of the image (CLI)
* `capgen.py` : Takes in the feature vector, produces image captions using LSTM (Long Short Term Memory network) (CLI and Webapp)
* `index.py` : Parses the `img/` folder, indexes images and their descriptions in the elastic search server (CLI)
* `query.py` : Given a description, returns nearest description and their image path as JSON response. (CLI)
* `main.py` : Main program, elastic search server must be running before launching this program. (CLI)
* `server.py` : launches the webapp to do the reverse image search (Webapp)
